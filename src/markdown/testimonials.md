> Robyn came highly recommended and she way exceeded my hopes.  She is a pleasure to work with and the creative understanding she brings to projects is enormous.  We shared a Pinterest board and after sending only one set of images, Robyn instantly understood my style of garden and grasped my “floral aesthetic” very accurately.   She sent visual suggestions of flowers to include in the herbaceous border I was creating and her suggestions showed that she had absolutely understood my taste in flowers.   Her wide and detailed horticultural knowledge enabled her to advise very precisely which plants/flowers would flourish in which environments.    I very much appreciated her sensitivity to the design, but I was also grateful how keenly aware of budget she was. Robyn recommended the best way to approach the brief while using my budget cleverly.    When planting, she has laid out my plants perfectly with a view to how they will grow in the coming years - not to how they looked as they went into the ground.  She is a patient and sensitive landscaper and I look forward to working with her again.

> I had lots of ideas but did not know which were best suited to our garden. Robyn listened carefully to me and has designed and planted a beautiful garden for us. I could not have done it without her expertise. Robyn works in a very professional manner and I have no hesitation  in recommending her.

> Robyn has been a godsend to me for the last year... As someone who gains great pleasure from our garden but who seems to spend a fortune on plants only to die or not thrive using Robyn's expertise & knowledge of plants has made such a difference. From her wonderful designs, to collecting and planting the areas, she has transformed our garden with a woodland area, a rockery and flower border... not only that she is a dab hand at pruning our fruit trees and other shrubs... I can't recommend her highly enough...
